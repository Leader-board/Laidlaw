# Letter finder microbenchmark

This is the microbenchmark that was described in Report 5, and is a modified version of this repository: (Text String)[https://github.com/Leader-board/Text-String-letter-statistics]

No results from this benchmark was used, as the latest version fixed many of the issues with older versions but ended up being too slow (and the older versions had an I/O bottleneck).
